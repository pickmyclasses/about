### Manh Dung Tran

Roles: Administrator Functions (React.js, Node.js, and Express.js)

- Background: My name is Manh Dung Tran. My nickname is Leon. My hobbies are driving and
  watching movies. I enjoy road trips and traveling to places that I have never been before. Some
  movie genres that I like are thrillers, action, horrors, mystery, adventure, animation, and
  comedy.
- Education: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
- Projects:
  o Spreadsheet: This is a desktop application that functions almost like Microsoft Excel.
  o Teaching Assistant Application: This is a web application that manages and tracks
  applications for Teaching Assistant positions. I learned the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
  architecture of a web application. I also learned how to build the front-end, how to
  connect the database to the back-end, and how the communication between the frontend and the back-end is done.
  o PickMyClasses: This is the capstone project of my team in CS 4500. It is a web
  application that allows users to review, pick, and schedule classes that they want to
  take. The users can see relevant statistics and comments of other students about the
  courses that they look forward to taking.
